# Projects
Welcome to my repo. 

# The dnscheck.py

run python dnscheck.py and enter an IP/Hostname.

# The locate.py

The locate.py requires geocoder.

pip install geocoder

Then run python locate.py to view location of IP or Hostname

# The NotePad.py

The Notepad.py is a simple text editor. I am attempting to resort back to an 80's time period with the green and black text. Still needs some work, but feel free to do whatever.
